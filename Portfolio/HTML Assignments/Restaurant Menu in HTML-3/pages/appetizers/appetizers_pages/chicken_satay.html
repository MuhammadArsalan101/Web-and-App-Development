    <p>: Chicken satay is a popular Southeast Asian appetizer consisting of skewered and grilled chicken. The chicken is
        marinated in a flavorful blend of spices, such as turmeric, cumin, and lemongrass, which gives it a distinctive
        taste. Chicken satay is typically served with a rich and creamy peanut sauce, providing a balance of sweet,
        savory, and slightly spicy flavors.</p>
