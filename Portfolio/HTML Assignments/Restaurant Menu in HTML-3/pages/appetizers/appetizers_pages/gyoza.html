    <p>Gyoza is a type of Japanese dumpling that is similar to Chinese potstickers. They are typically filled with
        ground meat, such as pork, and finely chopped vegetables, like cabbage and garlic chives. The dumplings are
        pan-fried until crispy on one side, creating a delightful contrast with the tender filling. Gyoza is served with
        a tangy dipping sauce made from soy sauce, rice vinegar, and chili oil, which adds a burst of flavor to each
        bite.</p>
