    <p>Potstickers are pan-fried dumplings that are commonly found in Chinese cuisine. They are typically filled with a
        choice of chicken, pork, or vegetables, along with a combination of aromatics and seasonings. The dumplings have
        a thin and delicate wrapper with a crispy bottom, while the top remains soft and tender. They are served with a
        soy dipping sauce, which enhances the umami flavors of the filling.</p>
