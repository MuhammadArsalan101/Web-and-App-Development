    <p>Thai iced tea is a sweet and creamy iced tea that is commonly enjoyed in Thailand and other Southeast Asian
        countries. It is made by steeping black tea leaves and spices like star anise and cardamom in hot water. The tea
        is then strained and sweetened with sugar before being poured over ice. Finally, a generous amount of condensed
        milk is added to create a creamy and indulgent beverage with a unique orange hue.</p>
