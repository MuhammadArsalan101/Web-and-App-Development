        ingredient, but variations with chicken or mixed seafood are also popular. The soup is flavored with aromatic
        herbs like lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime leaves. Other ingredients can include mushrooms, tomatoes, and
        lime juice, which give the soup its tangy and refreshing taste. Tom Yum soup is known for its bold and vibrant
