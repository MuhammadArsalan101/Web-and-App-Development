    <p>Teriyaki salmon is a flavorful Japanese dish that showcases a grilled salmon fillet glazed with a savory teriyaki
        sauce. The teriyaki sauce is made from a combination of soy sauce, mirin (a sweet rice wine), sugar, and ginger.
        The salmon is grilled until it develops a caramelized and slightly charred exterior, while the flesh remains
        tender and moist. It is typically served with steamed vegetables and rice, providing a well-rounded and
        satisfying meal.</p>
