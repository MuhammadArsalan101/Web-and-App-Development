    <p>Edamame is a simple yet delicious appetizer made from young soybeans that are harvested before they fully mature.
        The soybeans are steamed and lightly seasoned with salt, creating a savory and slightly nutty flavor. Edamame is
        often served in the pod, and diners can simply squeeze the beans out with their fingers and enjoy them as a
        healthy and addictive snack.</p>
