    <p>Spring rolls are a popular Asian appetizer consisting of crispy fried rolls filled with a mixture of vegetables
        such as cabbage, carrots, and bean sprouts. The filling is often seasoned with various herbs and spices. They
        are served with a sweet chili dipping sauce, which adds a tangy and slightly spicy flavor to complement the
        crispy texture of the rolls.</p>
