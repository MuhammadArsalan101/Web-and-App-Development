    <p>Bubble tea, also known as boba tea, is a popular Taiwanese beverage that has gained international popularity. It
        typically consists of a base tea, such as black tea or green tea, mixed with milk or fruit flavors. The tea is
        shaken with ice and sweetened with sugar syrup. The unique aspect of bubble tea is the addition of chewy tapioca
        pearls, also known as boba, which can be sucked up through a wide straw. Bubble tea comes in various flavors,
        including classic options like milk tea or fruit flavors like strawberry or mango, providing a fun and
        refreshing beverage experience.</p>
