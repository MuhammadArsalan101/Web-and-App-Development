    <p>Japanese green tea, also known as "sencha," is a traditional tea that holds great cultural significance in Japan.
        It is made from steamed tea leaves, which helps preserve the tea's vibrant green color and natural antioxidants.
        Japanese green tea has a fresh and grassy flavor, and it can be served hot or cold, depending on personal
        preference. It is often enjoyed during tea ceremonies or as a daily beverage for its refreshing and calming
        properties.</p>
