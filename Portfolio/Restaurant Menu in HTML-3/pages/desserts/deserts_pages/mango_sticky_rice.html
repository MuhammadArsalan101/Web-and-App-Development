    <p>Mango sticky rice is a popular Thai dessert that combines the sweetness of ripe mangoes with the creamy texture
        of glutinous rice. The sticky rice is cooked in coconut milk and sweetened with sugar, giving it a luscious and
        aromatic flavor. It is served with slices of fresh mango on top and drizzled with a coconut sauce for added
        richness. The combination of flavors and textures makes this dessert a refreshing and indulgent treat.</p>
