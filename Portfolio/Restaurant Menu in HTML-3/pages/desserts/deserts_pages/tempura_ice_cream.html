    <p>Tempura ice cream is a unique dessert that combines the contrasting elements of hot and cold, crispy and creamy.
        It starts with a scoop of ice cream, usually vanilla, which is coated in a tempura batter and quickly deep-fried
        until the outer shell becomes crispy while the ice cream inside remains frozen. The dessert is often served with
        a drizzle of chocolate or caramel sauce, adding an extra layer of sweetness and decadence.</p>
