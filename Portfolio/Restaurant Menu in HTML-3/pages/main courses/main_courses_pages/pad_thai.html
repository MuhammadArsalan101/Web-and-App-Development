    <p>Pad Thai is a well-known Thai stir-fried noodle dish that is both sweet and tangy. It typically consists of rice
        noodles stir-fried with shrimp, chicken, tofu, bean sprouts, and scrambled eggs. The noodles are flavored with a
        tamarind-based sauce that combines elements of sweetness, sourness, and umami. Crushed peanuts and a squeeze of
        lime are often added for additional texture and freshness.</p>
