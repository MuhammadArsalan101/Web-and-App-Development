    <p>Beef and broccoli is a classic Chinese stir-fry dish that features thinly sliced beef cooked with broccoli
        florets in a savory sauce. The beef is typically marinated and stir-fried until it becomes tender and flavorful.
        The dish is completed with a sauce made from soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and oyster sauce, which coats the beef
        and broccoli, creating a delicious blend of savory and slightly sweet flavors. It is commonly served with
        steamed rice.</p>
