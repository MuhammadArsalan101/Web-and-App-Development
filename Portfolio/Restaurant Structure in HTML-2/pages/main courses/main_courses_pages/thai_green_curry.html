    <p>Thai green curry is a spicy and aromatic curry dish that is widely enjoyed in Thailand. It is typically made with
        a fragrant green curry paste, which contains ingredients like green chilies, lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir
        lime leaves. The curry paste is cooked with coconut milk, meat (such as chicken or beef), and a variety of
        vegetables, such as eggplant, bell peppers, and bamboo shoots. The curry is served with jasmine rice, providing
        a rich and flavorful combination of spices, herbs, and creamy coconut milk.</p>
