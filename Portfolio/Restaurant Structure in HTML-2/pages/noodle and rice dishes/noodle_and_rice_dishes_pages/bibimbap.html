    <dd> <i>Bibimbap: Korean rice dish with assorted sautéed vegetables, beef, and a fried egg, served with spicy
            sauce.</i></dd>
    <p>Bibimbap is a traditional Korean rice dish that translates to "mixed rice." It consists of a bowl of steamed rice
        topped with various sautéed and seasoned vegetables, thinly sliced beef, and a fried egg. The dish is typically
        served with a spicy sauce called gochujang, which adds a kick of heat and flavor. Before eating, all the
        ingredients are mixed together to create a harmonious blend of textures and flavors. Bibimbap offers a balance
        of fresh and cooked vegetables, tender meat, and the richness of a perfectly fried egg.</p>
