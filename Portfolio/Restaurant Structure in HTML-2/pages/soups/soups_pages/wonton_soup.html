    <p>Wonton soup is a classic Chinese soup made with a clear broth, pork or shrimp-filled wontons, vegetables, and
        noodles. The wontons are small dumplings that are filled with seasoned ground pork or shrimp. The broth is
        typically made from chicken or pork bones, simmered with aromatics like ginger and green onions. The soup is
        often garnished with leafy greens, such as bok choy, and it provides a comforting and satisfying start to a
        meal.</p>
